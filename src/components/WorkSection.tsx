                        Created and contributed to a remote I-9 verification React & Python application for workers and employers at the pandemic's beginning. It enabled a user to fill out the I-9 form without help, similar to a Typeform setup, except intelligent pathing based on selection.

                            How it worked: An employer would log in and open a menu to create an invite request for the new employee; the employee would receive a link, and a new item would appear in the table of sent I-9 forms on the employer view; the employee would fill out the I-9 form in a guided step by step process, the form would adapt intelligently based on choices made whether new or updated, upon completion the employee could enter a socket-supported page with WebRTC camera feeds of employee and verifier, the verifier would approve or decline through a short menu process, and then the meeting would complete. Lastly, the generated I-9 PDF would be accessible to the employer and emailed to the employee.
